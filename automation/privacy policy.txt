1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how [Your Company / Site Name] (“we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, stores, and shares information when you use our website, services, tools, and automation features (collectively, the “Service”).

Our Service integrates with third-party platforms to assist users with listing management, inventory synchronization, analytics, and automation. Use of those third-party platforms remains governed by their respective privacy policies and terms.

2. Information We Collect
A. Information You Provide Directly

• Account information (name, email, username)
• Platform credentials or API tokens (when voluntarily provided)
• Inventory data, listing metadata, pricing, descriptions
• Uploaded CSV files or structured data
• Support messages and communications

Credentials are stored encrypted and used only to perform actions explicitly authorized by the user.

B. Information Collected Automatically

• IP address
• Browser and device metadata
• Usage logs and timestamps
• Automation execution logs (non-content based)

No biometric, no surveillance vibes.

3. How We Use Your Information

We use collected data solely to:

• Execute user-requested automation
• Sync listings, prices, and inventory across platforms
• Detect duplicate listings
• Provide analytics and estimates
• Maintain system integrity and security
• Comply with legal obligations

We do not sell user data.
We do not train AI models on private user data unless explicitly disclosed and opted into.

That sentence matters.

4. Third-Party Platform Integrations

This is the critical section.

Our Service connects to third-party platforms at the direction and authorization of the user. When you connect a platform account, you authorize us to access and process data as permitted by that platform and your account permissions.

Important Clarifications:

• Each platform retains independent control over its data
• Each platform’s privacy policy continues to apply
• We do not modify, override, or reinterpret platform rules
• We act only as a technical intermediary

You acknowledge that actions performed through automation are subject to the rules, limitations, and enforcement mechanisms of the connected platform.

This protects you from bans, throttling, suspensions, etc.

5. Automation & User Responsibility

By enabling automation features, you acknowledge and agree that:
• You are authorized to access the connected accounts
• You understand the platform’s terms of service
• You accept responsibility for actions initiated through automation
• Automation executes exactly as configured by you

We are not responsible for platform penalties resulting from user-configured automation.

This is non-negotiable.

6. Data Sharing

We may share data only with:

• Connected platforms (as instructed by the user)
• Infrastructure providers (hosting, databases, logging)
• Legal authorities when required by law

We never share credentials with other users or third parties.

7. Data Retention

We retain user data only for as long as necessary to provide the Service or comply with legal requirements.

Users can:
• Disconnect platforms
• Delete data
• Request account deletion

8. Security

We implement industry-standard safeguards including encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, and audit logging.

No promises of “perfect security.” Never say that.

9. User Rights

Depending on jurisdiction (GDPR / CCPA):

• Access your data
• Correct inaccuracies
• Delete your data
• Withdraw consent

Provide a contact email.

10. Children’s Data

Our Service is not intended for users under 18.

Simple.

11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of changes.

OPTIONAL BUT SMART: PLATFORM CONSENT SCREEN

Before users connect any platform, show a checkbox:

☐ I understand that connecting this platform authorizes automated access subject to the platform’s own terms and privacy policy.

This checkbox saves lives.
