🔐 AUTOMATION & DATA ACCESS CONSENT

(Plain-language rules by platform type)

This explains what we can do, what we cannot do, and what the user is agreeing to when they connect a platform.

🟢 Section 1: API-SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

(eBay, Etsy, Shopify, WooCommerce, Square, TCGplayer, Reverb, etc.)

What these platforms allow

These platforms provide official APIs designed for software access.

What we CAN do

Read listings and inventory

Read sales and order information

Read fees, taxes, and payout data

Update internal inventory status

Keep data in sync automatically

What we DO NOT do

Make changes without your authorization

Access data outside your account

Override platform rules or limits

How syncing works

Syncing may be automatic or scheduled

Data updates are usually near real-time

You can disconnect at any time

User consent confirmation

"I authorize this app to access my data through the platform's official API."

[Yes / No]

🟡 Section 2: CSV / FILE-BASED PLATFORMS

(Poshmark, Bonanza, eCrater, Ruby Lane, OfferUp, Biblio, Sportlots, etc.)

What these platforms allow

These platforms do not provide full APIs, but allow data access through:

CSV exports

Reports

Seller dashboards

What we CAN do

Import listings and sales from files you provide

Export data in platform-compatible formats

Detect sold items after import

Keep your internal inventory accurate

What we CANNOT do

Automatically pull live data without your action

Detect sales instantly

Modify listings directly on the platform

How syncing works

You upload or download files when you choose

Sync timing depends on when files are provided

We clearly show when data was last updated

User consent confirmation

"I understand that syncing for this platform is file-based and not automatic."

[Yes / No]

🟠 Section 3: USER-CREDENTIAL, READ-ONLY PLATFORMS

(Poshmark, Mercari, Grailed, Depop, Vinted, The RealReal, Vestiaire, etc.)

What these platforms allow

These platforms do not offer public APIs, but your account data is visible to you as a seller.

With your permission, data can be read carefully and respectfully.

What we CAN do

Read listing metadata visible in your account

Detect when an item is marked sold

Read sale price and sale date

Read payout summaries

Reconcile listing status with your inventory

What we CANNOT do

Post listings on your behalf

Edit or delete listings

Perform high-frequency or background automation

Access historical data before connection

How syncing works

Syncs are user-initiated or low-frequency

Updates may be delayed

We clearly warn when syncs are not instant

All access is read-only

Important acknowledgment

"I understand that this platform limits automation. Syncing may be slow and read-only."

[Yes / No]

🔴 Section 4: MANUAL / LOCAL / NON-AUTOMATABLE PLATFORMS

(Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, Nextdoor, VarageSale, local sales)

What these platforms allow

These platforms do not support safe programmatic access.

What we CAN do

Let you manually record sales

Generate invoices

Track profit, taxes, and inventory changes

Keep your records consistent

What we CANNOT do

Read listings automatically

Detect sales automatically

Sync data without your input

How syncing works

You confirm sales manually

We treat these as external sale sources

Inventory updates happen instantly once confirmed

User consent confirmation

"I understand this platform requires manual confirmation."

[Yes / No]

🧠 Global Rules (apply to ALL platforms)

Access starts from the moment you connect, not before

You approve each platform individually

You can disconnect any platform at any time

We do not sell or share your credentials

We do not bypass platform security

Your inventory inside this system is the single source of truth
