Before changing anything, treat this as a system-wide design contract, not a single-page redesign.

Brand color hierarchy (do not deviate):

Red = primary brand + primary actions only

Charcoal = foundational background / app canvas

Steel blue-grey = functional UI surfaces and secondary actions

Off-white = accent only (text, icons, outlines), never a surface

These are roles, not suggestions.

Button rules (global):

No button may be flat grey or solid white.

No page may invent a new button style.

All buttons must feel like materials (depth, elevation, interaction), not flat fills.

Button tiers:

Primary action → red (only one per page)

Secondary action → steel blue-grey

Utility action (Save Draft, etc.) → dark steel / charcoal surface with subtle edge highlight

Hover and active states must change material feel (light, depth), not just color.

Layout rules (global):

The landing page is the only page allowed to show multiple workflow entry buttons.

Logged-out landing page: marketing CTAs only.

Logged-in landing page: Create Listing (primary), Inventory, Storage (secondary).

Create page is a focused work page: AI actions + Save Draft only.

Inventory / Storage navigation lives under Account or global nav, not scattered.

Consistency requirement:

Color usage, button hierarchy, spacing, and elevation must be identical across all pages.

Do not restyle a single button in isolation.

Apply the system everywhere in one coherent pass.

Explicit constraints:

Masculine, industrial tone.

No orange.

No pastel.

No “flat modern” look.

Depth through tone, elevation, and edges — not flashy gradients.

If any part of the UI violates this hierarchy, it is considered incorrect.
