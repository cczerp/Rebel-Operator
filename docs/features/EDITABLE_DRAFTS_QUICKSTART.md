## ❌ Troubleshooting

### "Can't edit a cell?"
- Make sure you're **clicking on the text**, not the borders
- Try double-clicking if single-click doesn't work
- Refresh the page and try again

### "Yellow highlight won't go away?"
- That's normal - it shows what you changed
- Disappears after you **Save All Changes**

### "Save button doesn't show?"
- Click **at least one cell** to trigger it
- Check for error messages at the top

### "Changes disappeared?"
- Did you click **Save All Changes**? (important!)
- Browser may have refreshed - edit again and save

### "Can't delete an item?"
- Item might already be deleted
- Try refreshing the page
- Ensure it's checked before clicking Delete
